## Welcome to Five EMS Mod

This mod has come along way from Stretcher mod to an expansive mod. To unlock this mod
you must be part of Perks Program

This mod has evolved from stretcher to an missive EMS Mod for 5M with enhanced realism for roleplay servers.

This Mod incoporates current and past scripts and teams up with developers to make cool additions to this mod.

with this mod you can use on any compatible ambulance

allows the use of more than one stretcher, and to enable and disable stretcher options

I’ve been developing stretchers for this mod and the hopefully the ability to have a coroner vehicle that transports a player .

Bugs
1. sometimes scripts gets stuck requires a restart
2. some bugs with stretchers 
This came about when i was developing a pack of vehicles for 5M

This pack is WIP and i tend to add more vehicles every day to it while waiting on script
development.

```
Bcfd4 - international rescue engine
Bcfd5 - International water tender
safd2 - International 4 door cab, Hazmat Equip Transport
Safdm2 2020 Ram Ambulance with Lightbar
Safdm3 2020 Ram Ambulance No Lightbar
engine1 Pierce Dash CF
Emsgator - john deer 6x6 gator EMS/Fire and Pt transport options
Gatortrailer - atr2 all terrain rescue Patient transport
Cotrailer - trailer that can haul the gator
Tahoe - Pulls the trailer, by MiiKeMQ
stretcher - stryker M1 stretcher works with powerloader
Prop_ld_binbag_01 - new hazmat tent
safr2- 2020 Ford F450 Superduty Ambulance
rescuemedic - rescue medic can tow cotrailer as well.
options: working spotlight rotatable on ambulances, many other cool features and vehicle components, equipment and compartments that you can toggle on/off
```

the pack is developed to work with several 5M scripts, that utilizes stretcher script, and hopefully a script to work with the hazmat transport truck and decon tent.
