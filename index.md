## Welcome to Five EMS Mod

This mod has come along way from Stretcher mod to an expansive mod. To unlock this mod
you must be part of Perks Program

This mod has evolved from stretcher to an missive EMS Mod for 5M with enhanced realism for roleplay servers.

This Mod incoporates current and past scripts and teams up with developers to make cool additions to this mod.

with this mod you can use on any compatible ambulance

allows the use of more than one stretcher, and to enable and disable stretcher options

I’ve been developing stretchers for this mod and the hopefully the ability to have a coroner vehicle that transports a player .

### Bugs
1. sometimes scripts gets stuck requires a restart
2. some bugs with stretchers 
This came about when i was developing a pack of vehicles for 5M

This pack is WIP and i tend to add more vehicles every day to it while waiting on script
development.

No, it will not, only if that ambulance has a bonnet in the back patient compartment. either way the vehicle developer will need to make there vehicle compatible to the script.
